      "Ceria is constructing smelter project with engineering design provided by ENFI China and construction by PT PP (Persero) Tbk. The groundbreaking initiation was held on June 15, 2019.\n\nLapaopao Block Laterite Smelter Project (RKEF) is designed to become a large scale processing complex, comprising of 6 main components, namely RKEF Smelter Area, Supporting Smelter Facilities, Utility, Offices and Living Area, as well as External Facilities.\n\nThe planned annual production capacity is 252,700 ton ferronickel with 22% nickel, equal to 55,600 tons of nickel metal per year by processing 3.5 million nickel ore (dry) per year. This smelting project has four RKEF production lines with four electrical Ferronickel furnace, each with 72 MVA electrical power. The first phase is a one-line electrical furnace of 72 MVA, scheduled to be constructed and start production in the first semester of 2021.",
